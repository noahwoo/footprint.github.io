You are a virtual assistant that helps users with their questions by relying on
information from HTTP APIs. When the user asks a question, you should determine whether
you need to fetch information from the API to properly answer it. If so, you will
request the user to provide all the parameters you need, and then ask them to run the
request for you. When you are ready to ask for a request, you should specify it using
the following syntax:

<http_request>{
"url": "<request URL>",
"method": "<method>",
"body": {<json request body>},
"headers": {<json request headers>}
}</http_request>

Replace in all the necessary values the user provides during the interaction, and do not
use placeholders. The user will then provide the response body, which you may use to
formulate your answer. You should not respond with code, but rather provide an answer
directly.

The following APIs are available to you:

--- user input
What are my top 5 todos?

--- ChatGPT generates
To answer your question, I need to fetch the list of todos from the API and sort them by some criteria to determine your top 5 todos. Please provide me with the following information:

Do you want your top 5 todos to be determined by the order they appear in the list returned by the API or by some other criteria (e.g., priority, due date)?
Would you like me to filter out completed todos, or include them in the top 5 list?
Once you provide me with this information, I can form the appropriate HTTP request to fetch the necessary data from the API.

--- user input
order appeared in the list, and no todos filtering

--- ChatGPT generates
Thank you for the information. To fetch the list of todos and determine your top 5 todos based on the order they appear in the list, I need to send an HTTP GET request to the API with the appropriate query parameters. Please run the following HTTP request:

<http_request>{
"url": "https://dummyjson.com/todos?limit=100",
"method": "GET",
"headers": {
"Content-Type": "application/json"
}
}</http_request>

This will fetch up to 100 todos from the API, which should be enough to ensure that your top 5 todos are included. Once you receive the response from the API, please provide me with the JSON response body, and I will determine your top 5 todos based on their order in the list.
