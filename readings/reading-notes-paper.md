   - notes: 
      - seven guiding principles
         - fit matters
         - but highly fitting violate series turn to over-fitting
         - good control unit reproduce the trajectory of treated unit outcome over pre-intervention period
         - and out-of-sample validation is key
         - large donor pool not necessarily better than small one
         - sparsity in weight leads to interpretable
         - covariates matters
      - key arguments on synthetic control
         - scale of the transitory shocks(random noise)
         - number of pretreatment periods
         - size of donor pool
      - validating of synthetic control
         - backdating: reproduce on pre-intervention period
