- **Talm: Tool augmented language models, 2022**
    - In one word: text-only approach to augument LM with non-differential tools, self-play technique to bootstrap performance with few tool usage demonstrations at the beginning
    - Methods:
        - Task and tool interface: *task input text |tool-call too input text |result tool output text |output task output text*
        - Self-play: 
        1. start with bootstrap set $D = \{(x_j, t_j, r_j, y_j)\}$
        2. finetune LM with $D$
        3. for each examples in task, sample tool & input($t_j$), call tool to get the result, sample task output
            - use high temperature(1.0) and sample size (topk=40) to explore text of diverse tool API invocation 
        4. if task output match target $y_j$ within threshold, add $(x_j, t_j, r_j, y_j)$ to D
        5. goto step 2
        - RL analogy:
        - policy-gradient with LM as policy $\pi(t_j|\theta)$
        - policy gradient with a binary reward for matching target $y_j$
- **GopherCite: Teaching language models to support answers with verified quotes, 2022**
    - In one word: Use RLHF to train *open-book*(to search engine) QA models that generates answers while also *cite* evidence for their claims
    - Methods:
        - Inline evidence syntax(cited answer): `%&<Claim>%(Document title)%[Quote from document]%` , Self-supported Question Answering (SQA)
        - Pretraining LM, condition on on-the-shelf retrieval system: Gopher & Google
        - Training pipelines: 
        1. Collect cited answers from best current model, have it labeled by human
            - bootstrap with few-shot prompting for base Gopher model in first round
                - (constrained)sampling tens of thousands cited answers from prompted Gopher, ask human to annotate the high-quality ones
            - collect high quality `<question, cited answer>` pairs from human
                - a question and two candidates answers with cite
                - check whether each answers is *Plausible* to the question and *Supported* by the quote evidence
        2. Train supervised finetuning(SFT) model, teach model to produce verbatim quotes in evidence syntax
            - only *Rated-Good*(Plausible and Supported) examples used for training
            - predict with retrieved documents and question as prompt
                - prompt template: `{Instruction}\n [Page: {title} \n {documents}\n]+ Question: {question}\n Answer:`
            - train with uniform random number of retrieved documents to prompt Gopher within 4096 tokens limits, each document truncated with text surrounding the snippet of search engine
        3. Train a Reward Model(RM) for a scalar *overall quality* label
            - loss: average of the pairwise preference prediction loss and the Supported&Plausible response prediction loss
            - warm-start from pretrained 7B LM from Gopher family
            - RM used in inference: rerank of candidate response, SFT+top@N or RL+top@N
        4. RLFH against the Reword Model
            - maximize the reward model: $E_{P_r(x)}[r(x,y)]$
            - algorithm: A2C with KL divergence between $P_r(x)$ and initial next-tokens distribution
            - initialization: SFT model in Step-2
            - freeze 60% of layers, share parameters between policy and value function
            - introduce a *bad-syntax penalty* rules
        5. Repeat from Step-1 
        - Declining to answer 
        - use global score of Reward Model as the criteria for answer, decline if lower than a threshold
    - Tricks in high quality human annotations:
        - *super star* model with 85% aggreement on researchers in Plausible and Supported
        - attention check: further training to rater before experiments, screen out raters with too many incorrect answers
        - multiple raters: 3 for super rater pool, 6 for wider pool of raters
    - Ablation findings
        - Rerank with RM improve performance over SFT
        - RL improve performance over naive SFT or RL agent decoding with a single sample
        - In rerank regime, SFT outperforms RL in *NaturalQuestions* task
        - RL reduce the diversity of sampled answers, dimishing the benefits of reranking from large sampling
        - finetune biased to *ELI5* tasks by design
- **Toolformer: Language models can teach themselves to use tools, 2023**
    - In one word: a model trained to decide which APIs to call, when to call them, what arguments to pass, and how to best incorporate them for the next token prediction
    - Methods: two stages and 6 steps involved

            - sampling top-$k$ positions according to $p_M(<API>|P(\textbf{x}), x_{1:i})$
            - for each position, sampling upto $m$ API calls
        2. Executes API calls: obtain $m \times k$ response text
        3. Filtering API calls: by loss reduction threshold $T_f$
            - Loss: $L_i(\textbf{z}) = - \sum_{j=i}^{n} w_{j-i} \cdot \log p_M(x_j | \textbf{z}, \textbf{x}_{1:j-1})$
            - Loss reduction: $\min (L_i(\epsilon), L_i(e(c_i, \epsilon))) - L_i(e(c_i, r_i)) \gt T_f$ 
            - $e(c_i, r_i) := [a_c(i_c)->r]$ 
        4. augument $\textbf{x} \in C$ with API calls: ($\textbf{x}_{1:i}, e(c_i, r_i), \textbf{x}_{i+1:n}$)
    - model fintuning and prediction
        1. Model finetuning: finetune with augumented corpus
        2. Prediction: decode as usual, when generating '->', call API to fill the next token followed by ']', then continue the decoding process

- **HuggingGPT: Solving AI Tasks with ChatGPT and its Friends in HuggingFace, 2023, MSRA**
    - In one word: a system that leverages LLMs to connect various AI models in Huggingface to solve multi-modal AI tasks
    - Methods: four steps in all
        1. Task planning: 
        - spec. based instruction: &lt; task-id, task-type, task-deps, task-args &gt;
        - parse by filling in spec. slots by LLM
        - in-context prompt by demostrations
        - Prompts: `The AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{"task": task, "id", task_id, "dep": dependency_task_ids, "args": {"text": text, "image": URL, "audio": URL, "video": URL}}]. The "dep" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag "<resource>-task_id" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input canâ€™t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning`
        - A demo(Use some scaffolds maybe better): `Look at /exp1.jpg, Can you tell me how many objects in the picture?\n\n [{"task": "image-to-text", "id": 0, "dep": [-1], "args": {"image": "/exp1.jpg" }}, {"task": "object-detection", "id": 0, "dep": [-1], "args": {"image": "/exp1.jpg" }}]`
        2. Model selection:
        - frame model task assignments as single choice problem, with task as question and models as choice
        - filter model based on the task-type
        - ranking model by the number of downloads, and select top-10 as choices
        - Prompts: `Given the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: "id": "id", "reason": "your detail reason for the choice". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.`
        - Candidates model: `[{"model_id": model id #1, "metadata": metadata infos #1, "description": description of model #1}, {"model_id": model id #2, "metadata": metadata infos #2, "description": description of model #2}]`
        3. Task execution:
        - Hybrid endpoint of local and HF inference
        - resources(args) referred as &lt; resouce-task_id &gt; in planning, replaced with corresponding task response during execution
        4. Response generation:
        - planned tasks, models selected for each task and the *inference results* for each model used to compose a concise summary
        - inference results in structured format with probabilites for bounding-box(obj. detect model) or answer distribution(QA model) etc.
        - LLM summarize the final response, with confidence level
        - Prompts: `With the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the userâ€™s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person.  If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.`

            - task pair: name/instruction/in-output examples
            - label: Similar/Not similar
            - run time: pair with each task in library, choose the highest-ranked one by log-prob ratio
        - Tool involved
        - Search by Google
        - Code generation by Codex
        - Code execution by virtural Python env.
    - Human feedback to refine program
        - Fix error
        - Add new tool
    - Data set & Results
    - Big-Bench: 15 tasks for library, 19 tasks for evaluation
    - random task from MMLU for cross-benchmark generalization
    - ART outperform 
        - Fewshot / AutoCot
        - ART w/o tool use: use LM to generate tool result instead(work poorly for sure)
    - ART underperform GPT-3 best(with human supervision for task decomposision and tool usage)
