+   - notes: 
+      - seven guiding principles
+         - fit matters
+         - but highly fitting violate series turn to over-fitting
+         - good control unit reproduce the trajectory of treated unit outcome over pre-intervention period
+         - and out-of-sample validation is key
+         - large donor pool not necessarily better than small one
+         - sparsity in weight leads to interpretable
+         - covariates matters
+      - key arguments on synthetic control
+         - scale of the transitory shocks(random noise)
+         - number of pretreatment periods
+         - size of donor pool
+      - validating of synthetic control
+         - backdating: reproduce on pre-intervention period
